# 2. About SweetRewards
SweetRewards is not just a contact management tool; it's your partner in cultivating **customer loyalty and enhancing your bakery's membership program**. With SweetRewards, you can:

* **Track member information**: Keep a detailed record of each member, including their name, phone number, email, address, allergens, points, membership points, membership tier, and order history.
* **Manage orders and points**: Seamlessly add orders which automatically updates customers' points to reflect customer purchases and interactions.
* **Update membership tiers**: Automatically elevate members' tiers based on their membership points, unlocking new rewards and benefits aligned with each tier.

## 2.1 Understanding Membership Tiers and Points System
SweetRewards features a dual-point system designed to enhance customer engagement and loyalty: `points` and `membership points`.

### Points vs. Membership Points
SweetRewards employs a nuanced points system to foster both immediate and long-term customer loyalty. Below is a comparative overview of the two types of points within the program, showcasing their distinct roles:

| Attribute | `Points`                                                             | `Membership points`                                                   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose   | Serve as currency within the loyalty program for immediate rewards   | Track long-term customer engagement and determine membership tier     |
| Earning   | Earned through purchases and specific interactions within the bakery | Earned identically to Points but are cumulative and never decrease    |
| Redeeming | Can be redeemed for discounts, offers, or products                   | Not redeemable; solely influence tier status                          |
| Impact    | Affect immediate customer benefits and rewards                       | Determine the member's tier and long-term benefits within the program |
| Commands  | `addorder` increases points; `redeempoints` decreases points         | Only increased by `addorder`; unaffected by `redeempoints`            |

🌟 **Benefit**: While both types of points are earned through purchases, `Points` cater to immediate gratification by being redeemable for rewards. In contrast, `Membership Points` are designed to recognize and reward the cumulative loyalty of customers, influencing their progression through the membership tiers without direct redemption for goods or services.

### Membership Tiers: Criteria and Benefits
Members are classified into tiers based on their accumulated membership points. Each tier unlocks distinct benefits, rewarding members for their loyalty:

| Membership Tier | Perks |
|-----------------|------|
| Bronze          |   * Entry-level for all new members.<br/> * Offers basic rewards and incentives.  |
| Silver          |    * Requires members to accumulate a specified threshold of membership points.<br/>  * Unlocks enhanced benefits and rewards.|
| Gold            |   * A higher tier requiring more membership points. <br/>  * Offers substantial rewards and exclusive offers.  |
| Platinum        |    * The pinnacle of the membership hierarchy. <br/> * Members enjoy the best rewards and personalized services.  |


### Automatic Tier Updates
* Tiers are **updated automatically** as members reach the necessary membership points for each level.
* Ensures members are **rewarded seamlessly** for their loyalty and spending.

💡 **Tip**: By understanding and utilizing the dual-point and tiered membership structure of SweetRewards, you can effectively manage your bakery's loyalty program, ensuring that your customers remain engaged and appreciated.

💡 **Tip**: In this current iteration, the name, number and point requirement for the tiers are still in development. Hence, instead the users can change the number of points given to their item to suit their use

🌟 **Benefit**: By maintaining and upgrading membership tiers, you foster a stronger relationship with your customers, encouraging them to return to your bakery. This system not only enhances customer loyalty but also drives sales by offering tangible rewards for continued patronage.

# 6. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install SweetRewards on the other computer and copy the data file from your original installation directory to the new one. This will replace the empty data file created during the new installation.

**Q**: How do I manually add points to a member's account?<br>
**A**: Use the addpts command with the member's name and the desired amount of points. For instance: addpts n/John Doe p/50 adds 50 points to John Doe's account, useful for promotional points or correcting errors.

**Q**: How can I upgrade a member's tier manually?<br>
**A**: Employ the addmempts command with the member's name and the points you want to add. For example, addmempts n/John Doe mp/400 manually awards John Doe 400 points. The membership tier of the member will be determined by the number of points they have according to the membership tier table

**Q**: Is it possible to remove a member from the loyalty program?<br>

**Q**: How do membership points influence tier levels?<br>
**A**: Membership tiers are determined by the total accumulated membership points. Each tier requires reaching a specific points threshold, which is automatically tracked by the system. Check the "Understanding Membership Tiers and Points System" section for detailed tier requirements.

**Q**: How do I handle points for cancelled orders?<br>
**A**: For cancelled, use the `redeempoints` command to deduct the equivalent points from the member's account, keeping their points balance accurate with their actual purchases.

🚫 **Problem**: Double-clicking the jar file doesn’t open SweetRewards.<br>
✅ **Solution**: Verify that Java 11 or higher is installed. Open a command prompt, navigate to the application's directory, and type in `java -jar sweetrewards-v1.2.jar` (Note the version number might differ, use the one that is seen in the version of SweetRewards that you have downloaded) and press enter. If issues persist, re-download the jar file to rule out corruption.


2. GUI opens off-screen<br>
🚫 **Problem**:  SweetRewards starts off the visible screen area when using multiple displays.<br>
✅ **Solution**:  Locate and delete preferences.json in the application's folder to reset window positioning, then restart the application.

## Operational Issues
1. Incorrect Points Allocation<br>
🚫 **Problem**: Points were mistakenly added to the wrong member.<br>
✅ **Solution**: Use the edit command to adjust the points for both involved members. Replace the newly updated (wrong) number of points with the initial (correct) number of points and add the points for the new member again. For example, edit 2 p/50 to replace the wrongly updated points and addpoints 3 p/50 to add points to the correct member.<br>


2. Incorrect Member Information Entered<br>
🚫 **Problem**: Incorrect information (e.g., phone number or email) was entered for a member.<br>
✅ **Solution**: Correct the mistake by using the `edit` command to adjust points for both the affected and intended members, ensuring accuracy in the loyalty program.<br>


3. Orders Not Reflecting in Member's History<br>
🚫 **Problem**:  Newly added orders are not reflected in a member's history.<br>
✅ **Solution**: Verify that `addorder` was used correctly, including the correct member name and order details. This ensures all transactions are accurately recorded.<br>
